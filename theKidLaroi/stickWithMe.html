    Lyrics:
</h2>
<pre>
    Set adrift on memory bliss of you
    Set adrift on memory bliss of you

    Call me when it's late in the nighttime
    That's the only time I ever make time
    I don't like to text, hit me on FaceTime
    You say I ain't shit, but that you love me at the same time

    At the same time, baby, at the same time
    I don't wanna waste yours, but you could erase mine
    I've been thinkin' 'bout you ever since you came by
    There were plenty women, girl, but none give me the same high

    Up early, 10 AM, we on Rodeo Drive
    Spend a bag 'cause I got it, I don't fake mine
    Fuck whatever that they sayin', baby, take my
    Word, it's fine, I'm just high, sorry if I'm quiet
    I know the shit that you be on, so do not play me
    It's not a lot in this world that could phase me

    So, baby, stick with me
    Whether I'm right or whether I'm wrong
    Baby, stick with me
    Whether my money long or there's nothing at all

    Would you stick with me?
    It's nobody like you, and know if I'm true
    Girl, it just hit me
    Baby, stick with me, baby, stick with me
    Baby, stick-

    And I know that everybody else left in the dark
    And I know they run around with my name in they mouth
    But they never act the same or insane when I'm out
    And a lot was actin' strange when they came, now they out

    Dropped the brains out the coupe, but she my main and she flew
    Ask her how she came, private plane when she flew
    It's a different level, girl, I changed how you move
    All I ask is the truth, I do the same thing to you and it's

    Security in the black truck downstairs
    I still can't believe how insane my life is
    I still can't believe how you changed my life and
    Can't you stay right here? (Right here)

    So, baby, stick with me
    Whether I'm right or whether I'm wrong
    Baby, stick with me
    Whether my money long or there's nothing at all

    Would you stick with me?
    It's nobody like you, and know if I'm true
    Girl, it just hit me
    Baby, stick with me, baby, stick with me
    Baby, stick-

    Baby, just stick
    Set adrift on memory bliss of you
