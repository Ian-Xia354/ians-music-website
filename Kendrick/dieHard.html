    Lyrics:
</h2>
<pre>
I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I picked you up when you fell and cut your knee
Told you not to cry and held you close to me

I hope I'm not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me, yeah

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa puff
Serafina, flame in us
Where I'd be without your love?
Rest your wings and trust, I feel you
Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (too deep)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep

Do you love me? Do you trust me?
Can I trust you? Don't judge me
I'ma die hard, it gets ugly
Too passionate, it gets ugly
(Mmm, ah-ah) I wonder where I lost my way?
(Mmm, ah-ah) been waiting on your call all day

Tell me, you in my corner right now?
When I fall short, I'm leanin' on you to cry out
We all got enough to lie about
My truth too complicated to hide now
Can I open up? Is it safe or not?
I'm afraid a little, you relate or not?
Have faith a little, I might take my time
Ain't no savin' face this time

I hope I'm not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait, but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me, yeah

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa puff
Serafina, flame in us
Where I'd be without your love?
Rest your wings and trust, I feel you
Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (too deep)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep

I got some regrets (I-I-I-I-I-I-I)
But my past won't keep me from my best (I-I-I-I-I-I-I)
Subtle mistakes felt like life or death (I-I-I-I-I-I-I)
I wanna see the family stronger

I wanna see the money longer
You know that I'd die for you
I get emotional about life
The lost ones keepin' me up at night
The world be reminding me it's danger
I'll still risk it all for a stranger
If I told you who I am, would you use it against me?
Right or wrong, no stone, just love to send me

I hope I'm not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait, but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me, yeah

Baby, you make me pray for London, yeah
'Cause if I won it all without you involved (fucking love you)
I guess it's all for nothing
