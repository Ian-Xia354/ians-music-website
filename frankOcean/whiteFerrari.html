    Lyrics:
</h2>
<pre>
Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes
Watch the clouds float, white Ferrari
Had a good time
(Sweet 16, how was I supposed to know anything?)

I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times

Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text to speech, lesser speeds
Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me
Eventually, eventually, yes
Ah, on me eventually, eventually, yes

I care for you still, and I will (and I will) forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari (oh), good times
In this life (life), in this life (life)

One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
Thought you might want to know now
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life (oh-oh, oh)
(Love)

I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of movin', your body's achin' (whoo, ooh)
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly, this isn't all that there is (no way)
Can't take what's been given (no way)
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine (no way)

Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison (ah)
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam
