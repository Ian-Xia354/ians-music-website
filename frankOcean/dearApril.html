Dear April
The only face in the crowd that I know
Dear April
Are you watchin' him?
Are you watchin' him dance?
Dear April
We were safe for a while
We were safe as the years flew by

If you could take two strangers
Leaning left and right
At a certain place and time
Like you took these strangers
And our two strange lives
And made us new
And took us through
And woke us up

I believe that no matter what, it make us new
Take us through it
And wake us up again
What we had won't be the same now (same now)
But you will make something new
And it'll take you through this

If you can take two strangers
Leaning left and right
At a certain place and time
Like you took these strangers
And our two strange lives
And made us new
And took us through
And woke us up

I believe no matter what
Take us through it
And wake us up again
And what we had can't be the same now (now)
But you will make something
It'll take you through
It'll wake you up again

Just like you made me new (you made me new)
Just like you took me through (took me through it)
Just like you woke me up (woke me up, yeah)
You made me new
You took me through
You woke me up (woke me up)

Dear April
Are you watchin' him dance?
Dear April
Are you watchin' him dance?
