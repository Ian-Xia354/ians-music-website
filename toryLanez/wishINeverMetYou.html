    Lyrics:
</h2>
<pre>
Hey, ah, ah-ah-ah
Hey, ah
Ayy

Hurt, it hurt me before
You said "Let love grow, " but not no more
You took time to grow, stopped blowin' up my phone
And now I'm lo-lo-loaded with emotions tryna find out how to cope
It can't be with drinkin' dope, I been smokin' way too high

Drank so much I damn near choked, can't find your love in my skull
Think I need it I can't lie
Love you half, for me it's no more
It's okay, I knew this would happen one day

I can't lie, I just wish I never met you in the first place
Damn, why you had to come and kiss me in the first place?
Damn, why we had to even mix it in the first place?
Damn, then we went ahead and slid into third base
And I wish I never ever met you in the first place

Damn, why you had to come and kiss me in the first place?
Damn, why we had to even mix it in the first place?
Damn, then we went ahead and slid into third base
And I wish I'd never ever met you in the f-

Love, love don't come my way
It don't come my way, don't need to stay
Things I should have said
Things I wish I said I need to say
You always been my good lovin', I always knew
If I leave, find someone new, I'd still end up right back with you

A-anime, we watched anime 'til we can't watch
I can't watch no more
It remind me of you way too much
We came way too close
Didn't know losing you'd be way too much

I can't lie, I just wish I never met you in the first place
Damn, why you had to come and kiss me in the first place?
Damn, why we had to even mix it in the first place?
Damn, then we went ahead and slid into third base
And I wish I never ever met you in the first place

Damn, why you had to come and kiss me in the first place?
Damn, why we had to even mix it in the first place?
Damn, then we went ahead and slid into third base
And I wish I never ever met you in the f-

Lil' mama, get me high any time I take a low
Blew smoke to the sky, throw money at the floor
Workin' hard gettin' by, you would think about your dough
I'm just askin' God, "Why did she have to let me go?"

In the first place, wish I never met you in the first place
Oh-oh-oh, oh
