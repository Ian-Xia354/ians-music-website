    Lyrics:
</h2>
<pre>
Uh, do you not realize that it hurts me?
When I see you go out, uh
'Cause you have the time of your life
Only when I'm not around
You know, you really don't deserve me
Looking for you in the crowd
To see you dancing again
Out of mind, out of sight

But where you going home tonight?
Oh yeah
Where you going home tonight?
Night, night
Where you going going, going?

Yeah, you got what you need
Then you never came back around
Where you going going, going?
Now you got what you need
Now it's out of mind, out of sight

Do you not realize that it hurts me?
Just to see you had fun, uh
With those other guys 'cause I
Feel like I'm the only one
And everybody in the party
Lookin' for you when it's done
'Cause you got the glow, the shine
When they come around your arm

But where you going home tonight?
Oh yeah
Where you going home tonight?
Night, night
Where you going going, going?

Yeah, you got what you need
Then you never came back around
Where you going going, going?
Now you got what you need
Now it's out of mind, out of sight

I been tripping over how you actin'
Actin' like I left you behind
I think you do it for my reaction (oh)

Do you not realize that it hurts me?
