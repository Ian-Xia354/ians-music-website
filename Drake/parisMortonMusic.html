    Lyrics:
</h2>
<pre>
Would've came back for you
I just needed time
To do what I had to do
Caught in the life
I can't let it go
Whether that's right
I will never know
Oh, oh-oh

Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, but waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you (uh)
Would've came back (would've came)
Would've came back (would've came)

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, what's up with ya?
I hate calling the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers

This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to, did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me and fear that I won't remember?
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd

In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains? The seats for these heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up?

Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me, "Live in the moment"
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back, I

Would've came back for you, I just needed time
To do what I had to do, caught in the life
I can't let it
Whether that's right, I will never know

Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, but waited too long
But I would've came back,but I would've came back for you (uh)
Would've came back (would've came), would've came back (would've came)
