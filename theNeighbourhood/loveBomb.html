<h2>
    Lyrics:
</h2>
<pre>
She's a musician
You, you-ooh

Chlorine and pheromones
Fairy dust and moonstones

When we're all alone
Holding more than hands
Winded, collarbones
Up in smoke, again

I know it's crazy, I know that I'm a fool
I know it's way too soon to tell you, "I love you"

You-ooh
You, you-ooh

Raise my spirit up (up)
Never down when you're around (no)

When we're all alone
We're holding more than hands
Hollowed, coddled
Swallowed in a trance

I know it's crazy, I know that I'm a fool
I know it's way too soon to tell you, "I love you"

You just gotta say a few magic words
Baby, you're the one that's gonna break the curse
What's it really matter who says it first?
Say it to me, babe, I wanna break the curse

You just gotta say a few magic words
Baby, you're the one that's gonna break the curse
What's it really matter who says it first?
Say it to me, babe, I wanna break the curse

You just gotta say a few magic words
Baby, you're the one that's gonna break the curse
What's it really matter who says it first?
Say it to me, babe, I wanna break the curse
