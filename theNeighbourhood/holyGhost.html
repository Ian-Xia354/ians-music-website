    Lyrics:
</h2>
<pre>
Cage me up and take my information
Change my name and tell me what I want
Teach me how to take humiliation
Oh-oh
Chase me down and make a situation
Stay the same and ask me what I've got
Wish I listened to my intuition
For once, oh-oh, for once

'Cause I know what it's like
To feel alone
And I know what it's like
Losing a home
And I know what it's like
To steal a soul
Oh, I feel like a ghost

Car pulls over, rain is pouring
Heartbeat scoring every moment
Faster, slower, can't control it, oh
She said, let's keep going 'til the morning
I need more, hold me closer
Hold me closer, hold me closer
Hold me closer and closer and closer

Hold me close
Hold me close
Hold me close

Wake you up, middle of the night
Saw you in my dream, I need you right now
Made you late again, I'm sorry, baby
Never mind your time

'Cause I know what it's like
To feel alone
And I know what it's like
Losing a home
And I know what it's like
To steal a soul
Oh, I feel like a ghost

Hold me closer and closer and closer
Hold me close
Hold me close
Hold me close

Car pulled over, rain is pouring
Heartbeat scoring every moment
Faster, slower, can't control it
Hold me closer and closer and closer
