    Lyrics:
</h2>
<pre>
    Go ahead and bark after dark
    Fallen star, I'm your one call away

    Motel halls, neon walls
    When night falls, I am your escape

    When you lay alone, I ache
    Something I wanted to feel

    If you've been waiting for fallin' in love
    Babe, you don't have to wait on me
    'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
    But an angel ain't what I need

    Not anyone, you're the one
    More than fun, you're the sanctuary

    'Cause what you want is what I want
    Sincerity

    Souls that dream alone lie awake
    I'll give you something so real

    If you've been waiting for fallin' in love
    Babe, you don't have to wait on me
    'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
    But an angel ain't what I need

    Pull me, oh, so close
    'Cause you never know
    Just how long our lives will be

    If you've been waiting for fallin' in love
    Babe, you don't have to wait on me
    'Cause I've been aiming for heaven above
    But an angel ain't what I need
