    Lyrics:
</h2>
<pre>
This room could be haunted, a vision to the blind
Wishing sleep held me in her arms forever
Shadows dance around, perfectly blurring up the lines
Hallucinations start to intertwine

I open my eyes
Her face lingers on the walls
She's stuck on rewind in my mind
I try to move on, but the past won't leave my bed

I hear it all the time, like the wind between the chimes
Holding on to what we had together
A single note of my pеrsistent, hopeless lullabiеs
I know that I can't sleep forever

I open my eyes
Her face lingers on the walls
She's stuck on rewind in my mind
I try to move on, but the past won't leave my bed

I open my eyes
Her face lingers on the walls
She's stuck on rewind in my mind
I try to move on, but the past won't leave my bed
